BOSSO Texas Baseball research group repository.

Here is where we will keep track of our R code and data files. Upload data files with descriptitve names. It will be best to keep everything segmented into folders and smaller files so we can keep track of everything more easily, so try to put appropriate files in the folders for this repository. 

This is all subject to change, so let me know if you have any questions or ideas.
